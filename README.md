# Arduino_Bluetooth_Autonomous_Car

This project demonstrates how to build an advanced robot car capable of autonomous navigation and Bluetooth control. The car is built using Arduino Mega, HC-05 Bluetooth module, multiple ultrasonic sensors, and the Adafruit Motor Shield. It combines mechanical design, Arduino programming, and app development to create a versatile and interactive robot.

## Features
- Autonomous navigation using ultrasonic sensors (front, back, left, right)
- Bluetooth-controlled movements via a custom Android app
- Modular design with a 3D-printed chassis, motor mounts, and Arduino holder
- Powered by four DC motors controlled via Adafruit Motor Shield

## Components
- Arduino Mega
- Adafruit Motor Shield
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- 4 Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
- 4 DC Motors with Gearboxes
- Plexiglas chassis and 3D-printed mounts
- Battery pack for power supply
- Android app for Bluetooth control

## App Information
The app, `BluetoothCarControl_SP.apk`, is developed using MIT App Inventor and is compatible with Android devices. It enables manual control and toggling between manual and autonomous modes. The source file `BluetoothCarControl_SP.aia` is included for customization.
